The United Kingdom of Great Britain has the excellent transport infrastructure. Not only the huge tourist flow, but also the development of the country itself and, in particular, the business sphere contributed there. The total length of all roads is at least 399 thousand kilometers. At the same time, there are relatively few highways in the country. They make only about three and a half thousand kilometers. You can travel by car in any region of the country. Donâ€™t forget that the UK has the left-hand traffic. In London, there is a metro or a tube that embraces 12 underground, land and mixed lines. It is worth noting that the lines are often split into separate small branches, so you should always follow the transport route.
There are also taxi services in the country. The most expensive vehicles are black cabs. They can be stopped simply on the street. Cars are always upscale, with a clean and comfortable interior. Drivers use a meter. The less expensive taxi should be called on the phone. In this case, you need to clarify the price, since there is no meter in the cabin. Large cities have trams. In London, you can even find two-story trams.
